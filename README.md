 I solved this problem with two seperate, distinct approachs. One was to define the mappings as an object, the other was to defined the mappings as an array of objects with a key called "original" which is an array of characters we want to replace, and another key which is a string that is taken as the replacement value. I did this to demonstrate my comfort and capibilities working with both arrays and objects.
